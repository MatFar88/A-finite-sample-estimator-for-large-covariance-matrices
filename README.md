# A-finite-sample-estimator-for-large-covariance-matrices
This repository contains data and code relative to the manuscript "A finite sample estimator for large covariance matrices" by Matteo Farn√® and Angela Montanari. The data contain the covariance matrix of a selection of Euro Area banking supervisory data. Punctual data are not available due to confidenatiality reasons. The code contains the MATLAB functions "UNALCE.m" and "POET.m", which perform respectively the new procedure called UNALCE (UNshrunk Algebraic Covariance Estimator) described in the manuscript, and POET covariance estimation procedure (Fan et al., 2013).
