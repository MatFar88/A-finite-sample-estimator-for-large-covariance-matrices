# A-finite-sample-estimator-for-large-covariance-matrices
This repository contains data and code relative to the manuscript "A finite sample estimator for large covariance matrices" by Matteo Farn√® and Angela Montanari. The MATLAB dataset 'supervisory_data.m' contains the covariance matrix and the labels of a selection of Euro Area banking supervisory data. Punctual data are not available due to confidenatiality reasons. The code contains the MATLAB functions "UNALCE.m" and "POET.m", which perform respectively the new procedure called UNALCE (UNshrunk Algebraic Covariance Estimator) described in the manuscript, and POET covariance estimation procedure (Fan et al., 2013). 
The functions "UNALCE.m" and "POET.m" contain the detailed explanation of inputs and outputs.
The file 'supervisory_data.m' contains the covariance matrix 'C', and the relative labels of supverisory indicators, 'Labgood'. The labels may be interpreted exploiting the detailed description at https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/359626/Annex+III+-+FINREP+templates+IFRS.xlsx/049e48a4-e7c2-44c6-89b1-4086447bced9
